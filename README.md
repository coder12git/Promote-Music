# Promote Music

This project is submitted for [MLH - Do-Re-Mi Hacks 3 2022 Hackathon](https://do-re-mi-hacks-3.devpost.com/)

The Idea behind **Promote Music** is to build a hassle-free web application which will **help musicians**, to promote their music and get people to listen to their music so they can recognize their genius.

## What it does?

1. Upon visiting our web app the user is presented with a home Page where they can see basic details **Music Blogs**, **Radio Station** and **Music Forum**.

2. On **Music Blogs** page, user can see different blogs of different musicians and if they want to read more about them, they can click on Read More button which will render them to post page where they can see the complete blog of that musician. Also if they want to follow that artist they can go to the Follow Me part where they will see different social icons and on clicking on any of those social icons, the user will render to the social media page of that artist. Also user can see the link of the new song of that artist and if they want to share this post on any of their social platforms, they can do this by clicking on the social icons which I have provide on the left side of the page. Another thing that I had add is the donate part, where if the user wants to support that artist then they can donate money for them.
Now, if the user is a singer and if they want to write their own blogs, so that people can know their art, they can do this by clicking on **Add Blogs**, which will render them to add blog page where they need to provide some details about them and then they need to click on **Publish** button, to publish their post.

3. On **Radio Station** page, user can see different songs created by singers and if they want to listen that song they need to click on Read More part of that song which they want to listen and it will render to a new page where they can see the video of that song convered by that singer and also they can know more about that song by reading about it which is just below the video part on the same page. Again if the user wants to follow that artist or want to share this post on their social media or want to donate some money to that artist to support them they can do all these things on that same page.
Now, as a singer if they had created any new song and they had posted their song on spotify or YouTube but because of very less followers their song did not get a better reach, then they can promote their song on my site, by simply clicking on **Add Songs** part which will render them to a new page where they need to provide their song video and few details and finally they can click on Publish button to publish their song on the site.

4.The last feature of my site is **Music Forums**, where an artist can connect with those people who really care about art. It's a simple live chatroom where the user can chat with all those people who are online at that time. This feature will help small artists to grow their network, they can make new friends and ask if they want to listen to their tunes. 

## How I built it ‚öôÔ∏è

For frontend, I had used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. For backend, the real gem was to store data provided by user for which we had used MongoDB and Mongoose as a driver to connect MongoDB with node.JS. 

## Installation/Execution ‚úÖ

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate into the repo and run

   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. To start the server run

   ```
   node app.js 
   ```

## Challenges I ran into üíª
1. Fetching and Installing Dependencies 
2. Fixing Backend Errors

## Accomplishments that I am proud of üèÜ

I was able to complete the idea behind the challenge and create a hack that will inspire artists to create more by promoting their music online on my site. 

## What I learnt? üìö

If you have faith in yourself, you can do anything! This was my first solo project, and I was able to complete it on time.

## What's next for Promote Music?

Building a complete full-stack web application and helping the user to experience the best out of it.
